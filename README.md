## The source
https://freemusicarchive.org/genre/Breakcore_-_Hard
- Has 588 songs
- Random sampling (3 samples) reveals CC-BY-NC-SA (or less restrictive) license on each song
- Fermi approx: each song is 3 mins on average => ~29.4 hours of free music


## Automating the download
### The plan
- Acquire all download links
- Click all download links

### Approach 1: download all relevant HTML
- Download the listings
- Set items shown on each page to max (currently 200, page resisted trivial tamperings with max page size)
- Manually fetch (note to self: get better browser)
